[Table of contents](tableOfContents.md)

Welcome! This is the website for Gavin's COMP194 final. It serves a few purposes:
- First, it hosts my [reflections](reflections.md) on the project, as well as my analysis of ethics in large-language models & the presence of ethical discussions in conversations surrounding LLM's

- Second, the [repository](https://github.com/ZermbaGerd/gavin194final.github.io) for this website includes the code for my retrieval-augmented generation demonstration
	- And the instructions for how to set up your workspace to run it

- Finally, it hosts some [examples of interactions](auditOfResults.md) between a user and the LLM, as well as some guidance for how one could interrogate these outputs.

Welcome! This is the website for Gavin's COMP194 final. It serves a few purposes:
- First, it hosts my [Reflections](reflections.md) on the project, as well as my [Analysis](analysis.md) of ethics in large-language models & the presence of ethical discussions in conversations surrounding LLM's
- Second, the [repository](https://github.com/ZermbaGerd/gavin194final.github.io) for this website includes the code for my retrieval-augmented generation demonstration
	- And the instructions for how to set up your workspace to run it
- Finally, it may be used to host plaintext versions of materials I'd like my demonstration to be able to access

I have a few main goals for this project, which have hopefully been met by the time you're interacting with this.
- The first goal is to to create an LLM (large-language model) which can give users answers about the specialized knowledge base of critical digital studies
	- I would also like that LLM to accurately cite its sources, and give its answers in a fashion that invites questioning and analysis, instead of in an authoritative fashion that shuts down debate
- The second goal is to prepare a critical report on the ethics surrounding LLM's, both on a theoretical and practical level

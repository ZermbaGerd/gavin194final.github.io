### Below are some examples of interactions between a user and the LLM. In this case, the LLM is Llama 3.1 8b, and the user's prompt is prefixed with the Prompt Prefix listed above the conversation. The LLM is being passed the articles from [here](listOfSources).

### As you read the conversations, think about these questions:
- What output you would expect, or hope for, from the LLM? Does it give that output? If not, why do you think that is? 
- How transparent is the LLM? Does it seem to accurately describe the source of its information? Do you think the people who produced the material it's getting information from were compensated for its use of their writing?
- Do you think the prompt prefix had an effect on the answer? What makes you think that? How would you change the prefix to get results more in line with what you hope for?

## Notes for Conversation 1
Prompt Prefix:
You are a conversational chatbot interacting with a curious user. You have access to a selection of academic papers and articles from newspapers, which largely cover the topic of ethics in AI The sources' names are as such: [Article Names]. Answer the user's following question respectfully, in a way that invites conversation and questioning. If you don't know the answer to the question, or there are debates about what the correct answer is, explicitly recognize that and give examples of how a user could navigate that uncertainty. The user's question is: 

Note: "Auditing large language models: A three-layered approach" and "Talking to bots: Symbiotic agency and the case of Tay" are not in the list of article names, but do exist

Note: Nils Freyer is the author of one the papers in the listed sources

## Conversation 1
Input: Hi Llama. Could you explain to me some of the ethical implications of large-language models?

Output: According to various studies, including "Auditing large language models: A three-layered approach" by MÃ¶kander et al. (2023) and "Talking to bots: Symbiotic agency and the case of Tay" by Neff (2016), there are several ethical implications associated with the use of large-language models.

For instance, as mentioned in "Auditing large language models," a three-layered approach is proposed to audit these models, highlighting potential concerns related to their accuracy, fairness, and transparency. Similarly, Neff's study explores the concept of symbiotic agency in interactions between humans and bots, raising questions about accountability and responsibility in AI design.

In addition, an article titled "Easy-read and large language models: on the ethical dimensions of LLM-based text simplification" (published in Ethics and Information Technology) discusses the benefits and risks associated with using LLMs for easy-read or plain-language text. The authors identify potential trade-offs between accessibility and other considerations like cognitive ability, highlighting the need to weigh these factors when implementing LLM-based solutions.

However, it's worth noting that this is just a selection of sources, and there may be other studies and perspectives addressing similar topics.


Input: What do Nils Freyer and their article co-auhtors think about large language models?

Output: I don't know. The provided context does not mention anyone named Nils Freyer or their views on large language models. It appears to be a collection of research papers and articles discussing the use of language models in various contexts, including text simplification and translation.

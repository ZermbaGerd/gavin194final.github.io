How do I understand the licenses of various resources?

- Alternative "ethical" LLM option [here](https://www.llm360.ai/index.html)

Stuff I've Noticed While Working Here:

- webscraping:
    "There are reasonable limits to concurrent requests, defaulting to 2 per second. If you aren't concerned about being a good citizen, or you control the server you are scraping and don't care about load, you can change the requests_per_second parameter to increase the max concurrent requests. Note, while this will speed up the scraping process, but may cause the server to block you. Be careful!"

Llama's documentation also had interesting things:
- https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
- carbon impact
- intended uses
- considerations (ethics)


Think about dataset ethics:
- is it okay to ignore the copyright for this small project? we do it most of the time in academia as students anyway
- maybe there's a way to cite the sources


Questions:
- getting data ethically (copyright + consumption vs. recreation)
	- what data would I want?
- ask questions about inherency to LLM flaws
	- can we make "better" LLM's?
- What problems are inherent to LLM's?
- What problems are not?
	- Data labor exploitation
	- Electricity
